# harmonizer
A simple tool for generating harmonic realizations with 4 voices using simple rules. In its current state it's only console based and doesn't account for exceptions and special rules in harmonic realizations, but it processess the bases introduced and outputs an optimized path between all the chords.
Made in a weekend (from 11/5/2019 to 12/5/2019).
